# Sudoko-solver
#Project Overview
The Sudoku Solver is a robust Java application designed to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving but also emphasizes clean coding practices and user-friendly output presentation. The solver effectively addresses the classic 9x9 Sudoku grid and can handle any valid input configuration, showcasing the flexibility and efficiency of backtracking techniques in solving constraint satisfaction problems.
#Key Features
Backtracking Algorithm: Utilizes a depth-first search strategy to explore possible solutions while adhering to Sudoku rules.
Validation: Implements rigorous checks to ensure no duplicate numbers appear in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid, maintaining the integrity of the Sudoku puzzle.
Dynamic Input Handling: Allows for easy modifications of the initial puzzle setup, enabling users to input any valid Sudoku configuration directly in the code.
Formatted Output: Presents the solved Sudoku board in a clear, organized manner, making it easy for users to interpret the results.
Extensibility: Designed with the potential for future enhancements, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or advanced solving techniques, providing a solid foundation for further development.
